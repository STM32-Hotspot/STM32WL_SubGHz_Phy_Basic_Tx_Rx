# STM32-Hotspot/STM32WL_SubGHz_Phy_Basic_Tx_Rx MCU Firmware Package, based on STM32CubeWL Release v1.1.0

![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWL.svg?color=brightgreen)

**STM32Cube** is an STMicroelectronics original initiative to ease the developers life by reducing efforts, time and cost.

**STM32Cube** covers the overall STM32 products portfolio. It includes a comprehensive embedded software platform delivered for each STM32 series.
   * The CMSIS modules (core and device) corresponding to the ARM(tm) core implemented in this STM32 product.
   * The STM32 HAL-LL drivers, an abstraction layer offering a set of APIs ensuring maximized portability across the STM32 portfolio.
   * The BSP drivers of each evaluation, demonstration or nucleo board provided for this STM32 series.
   * A consistent set of middleware components such as RTOS, FatFS, LoRaWAN, Sigfox, key management services...
   * A full set of software projects (basic examples, applications, and demonstrations) for each board provided for this STM32 series.

The **STM32CubeWL MCU Package** projects are directly running on the STM32WL series boards. You can find in each Projects/*Board name* directories a set of unofficial software projects (Applications), which are not made available in the official STM32CubeWL Release. 

## Examples

This Hotspot FW package includes:
* Application example under "Projects\NUCLEO-WL55JC\Applications\SubGHz_Phy" called SubGHz_Phy_Basic 
   * This example implements a basic LoRa radio transmitter and receiver application between two Devices.
   * Development toolchains and compilers: STM32CubeMX v6.4.0 IAR EWARM V9.10.2
   * Supported Devices and hardware boards: NUCLEO-WL55JC
   * Known limitations: None

## Boards available

  * STM32WL
